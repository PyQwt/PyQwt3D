What is PyQwt3D?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class library
  which extends the Qt framework with widgets for 3D data visualization.
  PyQwt3D inherits the snappy feel from QwtPlot3D.
  The examples at http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/pyqwt3d-examples.html
  show how easy it is to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to
  an image or an (E)PS/PDF file.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, QwtPlot3D, the Numerical Python extensions
  (any combination of NumPy, numarray, and numarray) and optionally
  SciPy in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

The home page of PyQwt3D is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

- support for Python-2.5.
- support for Qt-4.2.x and -4.1.x
- support for NumPy-1.0, see http://numpy.scipy.org
- PyQwt3D.OpenGL gives access to a small subset of the OpenGL API
- EnrichmentDemo.py example demonstrates PyQwt3D.OpenGL

Bug fix in PyQwt3D-0.1.3:
- enabled support for SIP-4.5.
