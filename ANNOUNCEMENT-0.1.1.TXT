What is PyQwt3D?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class library
  which extends the Qt framework with widgets for 3D data visualization.
  PyQwt3D inherits the snappy feel from QwtPlot3D.
  The examples at http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/pyqwt3d-examples.html
  show how easy it is to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to
  an image or an (E)PS/PDF file.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
  (any combination of NumPy, numarray, and numarray) and optionally
  SciPy in a GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, MacOS/X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).


Changes:
- support for NumPy, see http://numeric.scipy.org
- support for SIP-4.3.x
- build fixes for MacOS/X
