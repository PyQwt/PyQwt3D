What is PyQwt3D?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class library
  which extends the Qt framework with widgets for 3D data visualization.
  PyQwt3D inherits the snappy feel from QwtPlot3D.
  The examples at http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/pyqwt3d-examples.html
  show how easy it is to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to
  an image or an (E)PS/PDF file.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, Qwt, the Numerical Python extensions
  (either Numeric, or numarray or both) and optionally SciPy in a GUI
  Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, MacOS/X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

The home page of PyQwt3D is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.


PyQwt3D-0.1 supports:

1. Python-2.4 downto -2.3.
2. PyQt-3.14 downto -3.12.
3. SIP-4.2 downto -4.0, but SIP-4.2 is recommended.
   PyQwt3D does *not* support SIP-3.x (I tried, but failed).
4. Qt-3.3.4 downto -2.3.0.
5. QwtPlot3D-0.2.4-beta.
