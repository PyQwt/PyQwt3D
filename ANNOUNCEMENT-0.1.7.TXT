What is PyQwt3D ( http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net ) ?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class library
  which extends the Qt framework with widgets for 3D data visualization.
  PyQwt3D inherits the snappy feel from QwtPlot3D.
  The examples at http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/pyqwt3d-examples.html
  show how easy it is to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to
  an image or an (E)PS/PDF/PGF/SVG file.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, QwtPlot3D, and NumPy or SciPy in a
  GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

- it is licensed under the GPL with an exception to allow dynamic linking
  with non-free releases of Qt and PyQt. 

PyQwt3D-0.1.7 is a bug fix release:
- Improved text display on screen and in pixmaps with Qt-4 and X (requires
  the use of the patched QwtPlot3D-0.2.7 library included in PyQwt3D).


PyQwt3D-0.1.7 supports:
1. Python-2.5, or -2.4.
2. PyQt-4.3, -4.2, -4.1, or -3.17.
3. SIP-4.7, -4.6, or -4.5.
4. Qt-4.3, -4.2, Qt-3.3, or -3.2.
5. QwtPlot3D-0.2.7.
