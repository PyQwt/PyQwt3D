What is PyQwt3D ( http://pyqwt3d.sourceforge.net) ?

- it is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class library
  which extends the Qt framework with widgets for 3D data visualization.
  PyQwt3D inherits the snappy feel from QwtPlot3D.
  The examples at http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net/pyqwt3d-examples.html
  show how easy it is to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to
  an image or an (E)PS/PDF/PGF/SVG file.

- it requires and extends PyQt, a set of Python bindings for Qt.

- it supports the use of PyQt, Qt, QwtPlot3D, and NumPy or SciPy in a
  GUI Python application or in an interactive Python session.

- it runs on POSIX, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (practically any
  platform supported by Qt and Python).

The home page of PyQwt3D is http://pyqwt.sourceforge.net.

New features in PyQwt3D-0.1.5:
- upgrade to QwtPlot3D-0.2.7.
- upgrade to PyQt-4.3, PyQt-3.17.3, and SIP-4.7.
- support for SVG and PGF file formats.
- new save() and plot() functions to facilitate saving of plots to a file
  and function plotting with nicely scaled axes.

Bug fixes:
- the result of IO.outputHandler(format) now has the correct type
- fixed saving to pixmap formats in qt4examples/Grab.py
